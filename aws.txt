Answers
1) C – The ability to launch instances on demand when needed allows users to launch and terminate instances in
response to a varying workload. This is a more economical practice than purchasing enough on-premises servers
to handle the peak load.
2) B – AWS DMS helps users migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely. The source database remains
fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime to applications that rely on the database. AWS DMS
can migrate data to and from most widely used commercial and open-source databases.
3) D – AWS Marketplace is a digital catalog with thousands of software listings from independent software
vendors that makes it easy to find, test, buy, and deploy software that runs on AWS.
4) D – Amazon VPC lets users provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where users can launch
AWS resources in a virtual network that they define.
5) B – Maintaining physical hardware is an AWS responsibility under the AWS shared responsibility model.
6) B – To deliver content to users with lower latency, Amazon CloudFront uses a global network of points of
presence (edge locations and regional edge caches) worldwide.
7) C – Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a simple best practice that adds an extra layer of protection on top of a
username and password. With MFA enabled, when a user signs in to an AWS Management Console, they will be
prompted for their username and password (the first factor—what they know), as well as for an authentication
code from their MFA device (the second factor—what they have). Taken together, these multiple factors provide
increased security for AWS account settings and resources.
8) B – AWS CloudTrail helps users enable governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of their
AWS accounts. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. Events
include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (CLI), and AWS SDKs
and APIs.
9) A – Amazon SNS and Amazon CloudWatch are integrated so users can collect, view, and analyze metrics for
every active SNS. Once users have configured CloudWatch for Amazon SNS, they can gain better insight into the
performance of their Amazon SNS topics, push notifications, and SMS deliveries.
10) D – The AWS Acceptable Use Policy provides information regarding prohibited actions on the AWS
infrastructure.

C) Assign Elastic IP addresses to the EC2 instances.
D) Define a custom route table with a route to the internet gateway for internet traffic and associate it with
the private subnets for the application tier.
E) Configure a NAT instance in a private subnet.
2) A solutions architect wants to design a solution to save costs for Amazon EC2 instances that do not
need to run during a 2-week company shutdown. The applications running on the EC2 instances store
data in instance memory that must be present when the instances resume operation.
Which approach should the solutions architect recommend to shut down and resume the EC2 instances?
A) Modify the application to store the data on instance store volumes. Reattach the volumes while restarting
them.
B) Snapshot the EC2 instances before stopping them. Restore the snapshot after restarting the instances.
C) Run the applications on EC2 instances enabled for hibernation. Hibernate the instances before the 2-
week company shutdown.
D) Note the Availability Zone for each EC2 instance before stopping it. Restart the instances in the same
Availability Zones after the 2-week company shutdown.
3) A company plans to run a monitoring application on an Amazon EC2 instance in a VPC. Connections
are made to the EC2 instance using the instance’s private IPv4 address. A solutions architect needs to
design a solution that will allow traffic to be quickly directed to a standby EC2 instance if the application
fails and becomes unreachable.
Which approach will meet these requirements?
A) Deploy an Application Load Balancer configured with a listener for the private IP address and register the
primary EC2 instance with the load balancer. Upon failure, de-register the instance and register the
standby EC2 instance.
B) Configure a custom DHCP option set. Configure DHCP to assign the same private IP address to the
standby EC2 instance when the primary EC2 instance fails.
C) Attach a secondary elastic network interface to the EC2 instance configured with the private IP address.
Move the network interface to the standby EC2 instance if the primary EC2 instance becomes
unreachable.
D) Associate an Elastic IP address with the network interface of the primary EC2 instance. Disassociate the
Elastic IP from the primary instance upon failure and associate it with a standby EC2 instance.

7) A company runs an online voting system for a weekly live television program. During broadcasts,
users submit hundreds of thousands of votes within minutes to a front-end fleet of Amazon EC2
instances that run in an Auto Scaling group. The EC2 instances write the votes to an Amazon RDS
database. However, the database is unable to keep up with the requests that come from the EC2
instances. A solutions architect must design a solution that processes the votes in the most efficient
manner and without downtime.
Which solution meets these requirements?
A) Migrate the front-end application to AWS Lambda. Use Amazon API Gateway to route user requests to
the Lambda functions.
B) Scale the database horizontally by converting it to a Multi-AZ deployment. Configure the front-end
application to write to both the primary and secondary DB instances.
C) Configure the front-end application to send votes to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
queue. Provision worker instances to read the SQS queue and write the vote information to the database.
D) Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to create a scheduled event to re-provision the
database with larger, memory optimized instances during voting periods. When voting ends, re-provision
the database to use smaller instances.
8) A company has a two-tier application architecture that runs in public and private subnets. Amazon EC2
instances running the web application are in the public subnet and an EC2 instance for the database runs
on the private subnet. The web application instances and the database are running in a single Availability
Zone (AZ).
Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to provide high availability for this
architecture? (Select TWO.)
A) Create new public and private subnets in the same AZ.

Sample Exam Questions

Answers
1) A, B – A NAT gateway forwards traffic from the EC2 instances in the private subnet to the internet or other
AWS services, and then sends the response back to the instances. After a NAT gateway is created, the route
tables for private subnets must be updated to point internet traffic to the NAT gateway.
2) C – Hibernating EC2 instances save the contents of instance memory to an Amazon Elastic Block Store
(Amazon EBS) root volume. When the instances restart, the instance memory contents are reloaded.
3) C – A secondary elastic network interface can be added to an EC2 instance. While primary network interfaces
cannot be detached from an instance, secondary network interfaces can be detached and attached to a different
EC2 instance.
4) A – Web browsers will block running a script that originates from a server with a domain name that is different
from the webpage. Amazon S3 can be configured with CORS to send HTTP headers that allow the script to run.
5) C, D – Server-side encryption with customer-provided keys (SSE-C) enables Amazon S3 to encrypt objects on
the server side using an encryption key provided in the PUT request. The same key must be provided in the GET
requests for Amazon S3 to decrypt the object. Customers also have the option to encrypt data on the client side
before uploading it to Amazon S3, and then they can decrypt the data after downloading it. AWS software
development kits (SDKs) provide an S3 encryption client that streamlines the process.
6) A – While Spot Instances would be the least costly option, they are not suitable for jobs that cannot be
interrupted or must complete within a certain time period. On-Demand Instances would be billed for the number of
seconds they are running.
7) C – Decouple the ingestion of votes from the database to allow the voting system to continue processing votes
without waiting for the database writes. Add dedicated workers to read from the SQS queue to allow votes to be
entered into the database at a controllable rate. The votes will be added to the database as fast as the database
can process them, but no votes will be lost.
8) B, E – Create new subnets in a new Availability Zone (AZ) to provide a redundant network. Create an Auto
Scaling group with instances in two AZs behind the load balancer to ensure high availability of the web application
and redistribution of web traffic between the two public AZs. Create an RDS DB instance in the two private
subnets to make the database tier highly available too.
9) C – The current configuration puts new EC2 instances into service before they are able to respond to
transactions. This could also cause the instances to overscale. With a step scaling policy, you can specify the
number of seconds that it takes for a newly launched instance to warm up. Until its specified warm-up time has
expired, an EC2 instance is not counted toward the aggregated metrics of the Auto Scaling group. While scaling
out, the Auto Scaling logic does not consider EC2 instances that are warming up as part of the current capacity of
the Auto Scaling group. Therefore, multiple alarm breaches that fall in the range of the same step adjustment
result in a single scaling activity. This ensures that you do not add more instances than you need.
10) C – Aurora Replicas provide a way to offload read traffic. Aurora Replicas share the same underlying storage
as the main database, so lag time is generally very low. Aurora Replicas have their own endpoints, so the
application will need to be configured to direct read traffic to the new endpoints.

Sample Exam Questions

Answers
1) D – IAM roles for EC2 instances allow applications running on the instance to access AWS resources
without having to create and store any access keys. Any solution involving the creation of an access key
then introduces the complexity of managing that secret.
2) B, D – Both DynamoDB and ElastiCache provide high performance storage of key-value pairs.
CloudWatch and ELB are not storage services. Storage Gateway is a storage service, but it is a hybrid
storage service that enables on-premises applications to use cloud storage.
3) B – If a versioned object is deleted, then it can still be recovered by retrieving the final version. Response
A would lose any changes committed since the previous snapshot. Storing the data in 2 S3 buckets
would provide slightly more protection, but a user could still delete the object from both buckets. EC2
instance storage is ephemeral and should never be used for data requiring durability.
4) C – Amazon Aurora is a relational database that will automatically scale to accommodate data growth.
Amazon Redshift does not support read replicas and will not automatically scale. DynamoDB is a NoSQL
service, not a relational database. Amazon S3 is object storage, not a relational database.
5) A – EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD provides sustained performance for mission-critical low-latency
workloads. EBS General Purpose SSD can provide bursts of performance up to 3,000 IOPS and have a
maximum baseline performance of 10,000 IOPS for volume sizes greater than 3.3 TB. The 2 HDD options
are lower cost, high throughput volumes.
6) C – A single EC2 instance will not scale and is a single point of failure in the architecture. A much better
solution would be to have EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across 2 availability zones read
messages from the queue. The other responses are all managed services that can be configured to scale
or will scale automatically.
7) B – Lifecycle configuration allows lifecycle management of objects in a bucket. The configuration is a set
of one or more rules, where each rule defines an action for Amazon S3 to apply to a group of objects.
Bucket policies and IAM define access to objects in an S3 bucket. CORS enables clients in one domain
to interact with resources in a different domain.
8) D – VPC endpoints for Amazon S3 provide secure connections to S3 buckets that do not require a
gateway or NAT instances. NAT Gateways and Internet Gateways still route traffic over the Internet to the
public endpoint for Amazon S3. There is no way to connect to Amazon S3 via VPN.
9) C – A security group can grant access to traffic from the allowed networks via the CIDR range for each
network. VPC peering and VPN are connectivity services and cannot control traffic for security. Amazon
Redshift user accounts address authentication and authorization at the user level and have no control
over network traffic.
10) C – The online application must be in public subnets to allow access from clients' browsers. The database
cluster must be in private subnets to meet the requirement that there be no access from the Internet. A
